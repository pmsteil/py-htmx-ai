todo:
- generally clean things up and make it easier to maintain
- make the inclusion of the already rendered html to the ai optional
- add the ability to add or delete sections from the page
- add the ability to enter a url or upload some html and have the ai edit that html
    - have the website dynamically add hx-ai buttons to the different sections of the page
    - maybe there should be a button that would appear on every element of the page when you mouse over that element
- maybe include the context of the whole page of html to the ai so the ai can better implement each section
- maybe you should be able to give the ai more context like a whole other webpage... like I could tell the ai
to make an about me page for a website where the rest of the site already exists and I could supply the html for the rest of the site
- add a login screen
- add the ability for the user to supply an OpenAI API key
- add a style guide for the user to set fonts, colors, logos, etc for the ai to use
- add the ability to preview the prototype without the elements that aren't apart of the prototype
- fix the way we're handling prototype.html to be more dry and modular
- make everything look good and professional
    - make the text area appear directly above the provide prompt button
    - make all the non-prototype elements slightly transparent
    - it seems like the top bar might be in the way a bit because the ai generated html might appear behind it
    maybe I should make it disappear unless the user brings their mouse towards the top of the screen
    - maybe make all the non-prototype elements disappear unless you move the mouse towards them
- put this baby on the internet
- get rid of hx-ai and just use hx-get
